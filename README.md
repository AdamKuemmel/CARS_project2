# Title of Project
Group Project 2, Side Swipe


## Description of Project
This second Group Project was to build both the front and back-end to a website of our choosing. After group deliberations, we decided on a website that we named Side Swipe that simplifies and allows individuals to buy and sell their cars online.
The owner can upload information as well as photos of their car and post it to our site. Those looking for a car can conversely search for cars to purchase with their desired traits such as price point, make and model of car and color.
Upon arrival at our site, the user is directed to login on the homepage. They can then navigate to their personal page with persisting data from their searches, or they can continue to scroll through the cards/listings other sellers have posted.
In order to post a car for sale, an individual utilizes an API by the name of Cloudinary, which is a built-in feature to our front-end design. This API takes the images and information posted by the user and formats it uniformly into our website, making it simple for the average person to participate in the buying and selling process.
Contact information is posted alongside the vehicle so individuals can contact one another regarding their cars.
Buying and selling has never been easier for individuals not wanting to involve a third-party.
